# Conner's Retime Tool (CRT)

CRT is a cross-platform software that aids speedrunners and moderators in finding the accurate time of a speedrun with or without loads. 

This is an evolution from PyTime, my previous retimer project. CRT retains all of the features of PyTime, but adds features, like on-the-fly timing, load editing, various optimizations, and more!

## Installation

- [Windows](https://github.com/connerglover/Conners-Retime-Tool/releases/latest/crt.exe)
- [Mac OS](https://github.com/connerglover/Conners-Retime-Tool/releases/latest/crt.exe)

1. Navigate to the [releases](https://github.com/connerglover/Conners-Retime-Tool/releases/) page, here is every binary of PyTime.
2. Locate your desired binary, the version is indicated by the title of each release, as every binary is named the same.
3. Once the binary has been located, click on it to download. Once the download has finished, open the file. If you're on Mac, you must drag it to your Applications folder before opening it.

## Usage

To use CRT refer to the following step-by-step tutorial.

1. Set the framerate. If you're on Youtube, then you can right-click the YouTube video player and click "Stats for nerd" at "Current / Optimal Res" where a resolution is visible, the resolution will be followed by @XX, the XX is the video's framerate, input that into the input box called "FPS."
2. Get the frame of the start of your speedrun. If you're on YouTube then you can right-click on the video player and press "Copy Debug Info". You can then paste this into the frame section, by either pressing the "Paste" button next to the input or clicking inside the text box and pasting with [Ctrl + V]. CRT will parse the debug info into a frame Do the same for the end of the speedrun.
3. Find the loads. If you speedrun doesn't have any loads
