You can then paste this into the frame section, by either pressing the "Paste" button next to the input or clicking inside the text box and pasting with [Ctrl + V]. CRT will parse the debug info into a frame Do the same for the end of the speedrun.
3. Find the loads. If your speedrun doesn't have any loads you should be good to go. Otherwise, you must locate the start and end of the load the same way you did for the last step. Once you've gathered those, click the "Add Load" button. You should get a confirmation if everything was done right.
4. Editing/Removing Loads. If you've made the mistake of inputting an incorrect load, simply press the "Edit Loads" button. In this menu you will be able to edit any load, just click the edit button right next to the load causing a new menu to open. In the menu, you just have to edit the time as you would set it initially. Press "Save" to save your new load or press "Discard Changes" to discard.

This should be the easiest part of them all, if you'd like to get the mod note, you just simply press on "Copy Mod Note", this will set your clipboard to the mod note. The time is displayed right below it, clicking on the times will copy them to your clipboard.
